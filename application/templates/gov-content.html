    <h2>Bankruptcy - Applications for Form J restrictions</h2>
    <p>
      Where one or more of joint registered proprietors is subject to a petition in bankruptcy or bankruptcy order, neither a bankruptcy notice nor a bankruptcy restriction will be entered. However, the Official Receiver or trustee in bankruptcy may apply in form RX1 for a Form J restriction once the bankruptcy order has been made.

    <p>Where a petition in bankruptcy is filed in the court against a sole registered proprietor, a bankruptcy notice is entered in the register. Once the bankruptcy order has been made against a sole registered proprietor, a bankruptcy restriction is entered in the register.
A trustee in bankruptcy should not apply for a Form J restriction where:</p>
<p><li>a bankruptcy inhibition or bankruptcy restriction is entered in the register, and</p>
<p><li>the trustee accepts that the registered estate has vested in them.</p>
This is because, given the existing bankruptcy entry, the entry of the restriction isn't necessary or desirable within s.42(1), LRA 2002. Further, a trustee probably can't rely upon r.93(j), LRR 2003 as they don't have a beneficial interest - a person who is the undivided legal and beneficial owner of property has no separate equitable interest in it (Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC [1996] AC 669 at 705).
